Gemini has some questions:
------------------------------------------------------------
To ensure the robot draws the circle exactly as you intend, I need a few more details:      

1.  **Orientation:** Should the circle be horizontal (like stirring a pot) or vertical (like drawing on a whiteboard/window)?
2.  **Size:** What is the approximate radius of the circle? (e.g., small like a cup, large like a steering wheel?)
3.  **Location:** Roughly where should the center of the circle be? (e.g., centered in front at chest height, lower down, or off to one side?)
4.  **Repetition:** How many times should it draw the circle?
5.  **Speed:** Should the drawing motion be slow and deliberate or relatively fast?

Your answer: vertical like drawing on a whiteboard, large like a wheel, chest height in fron
t of you, just draw it once, medium pace and should be smooth
